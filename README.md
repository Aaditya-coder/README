Story:-
Donkey Kong kidnapped the beautiful princess of the kingdom where Mario lived. The King had kept a prize of 10,000 gold coins for finding the princess. Many people volunteered to find her, the best of the best but it was only Mario who could find the ape’s domain. Now he needs our help to defeat the evil creature, take back the princess and restore peace in the kingdom.
